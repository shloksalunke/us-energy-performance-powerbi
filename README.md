 U.S. Energy Performance Analytics Dashboard (Power BI)

📌 Project Overview

 This project is a Business Intelligence analytics solution developed in 2025 using Power BI, focused on analyzing U.S. energy performance using historical datasets from 2023–2024.

 The dashboard provides insights into renewable vs non-renewable energy consumption, carbon emissions, energy cost efficiency, and regional sustainability performance.
 It demonstrates an end-to-end BI workflow, from data preparation and modeling to advanced analytics and visualization.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

 Power BI

 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)

 Data Cleaning & Transformation

 Data Modeling (Star Schema)

 Time-Series & Geographical Analytics

🧱 Data Modeling & Architecture

 Designed a star-schema data model consisting of:

 Fact tables for energy consumption, emissions, and weather data

 Dimension tables for date, location, and energy type

 Built and managed relationships to enable accurate aggregations and slicing.

 Optimized the model for analytical performance and scalability.
